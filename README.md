# Tetra tools

Tools and code libraries for tetromino stackers.

## Tools
- `gomen`: very basic web interface for perfect clear solutions
- `precompute`: compute all possible 10-piece perfect clears

## Libraries

- `srs-4l`: 4-line bitboards, implementing SRS

#### Why "gomen"?

- fumen = 譜面 = ふめん = 2めん
- 2めん + 3 = 5めん
- 5めん = ごめん = gomen

Sorry.  It's a terrible pun.  Hopefully I come up with another name.
